**Paperima** is a static **web app** built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, designed to create **paper-like effects** on images.  
It helps creators add realistic textures such as folds, torn edges, wiggle effects, and open/close paper animations, then export the result as a video (with optional greenscreen).
